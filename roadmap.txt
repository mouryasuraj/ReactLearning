What exactly is React.JS?
--> React is a javascript library that is used to build user interfaces, particularly a Single Page Application. It was developed by jordan walke, a software engineer at facebook and is often used for building web application that are scalable, fast and maintainable. React allows developers to create reusable UI component, which can help building and maintaining the user interface easier and more efficient. Instead of having rewrite the same code every time you want to create a similar element on a webpage, you can simply use a REact component you've already built.
